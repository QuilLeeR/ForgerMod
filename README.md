## Description

**Forger Patches Manager** Forger Patches Manager is used to unpack and repack forges and thus apply patches... in other words, apply/install mods for Assassin's Creed games. The tool was developed by hypermorphic and version 2.10 is being used as the base for this modded version.

## Installation

1. Download and unzip the **Forger 4.0.0** utility tool from releases.
2. Open the `Forger By QuilLeeR.exe` file, select your game, and install your mods by dragging `.forger2`, `.rar` files, or even folders into the tool. If any errors occur, you can always go to the `ForgerPatches` folder (the tool has a button to go to the folder) and add your mods there.
3. Then simply activate your mods (if the mods don't appear, you must perform a rescan with this icon <img src="https://i.imgur.com/VKvtqgh.png" alt="Rescan Icon" width="20" height="20" style="margin-bottom: -4px;"/> or restart the tool).

## Usage

1. Open the Forger Patches Manager and load the `.forger2` files.
2. Apply the patches by selecting the mods you want to install.
3. Save the changes and restart the game for the mods to take effect.

## Changelog
- `The design has been changed but the essence of the original has been maintained.`

- `Added Modder Mode button (used to disable mods when exiting the game).`
- `Added Uncheck All button (used to disable all active mods).`
- `When you hover the mouse over any button, a floating message will appear with information about its use.`
- `In the optiongroup window: every time the window is opened it will remember the chosen option and the next time you open it it will select the option below this is useful for a consecutive selection of options... in other words to select faster, the ability to select options with space or enter has also been added.`
- `The speed and smoothness of scrolling in the optiongroup window has been modified.`
- `Added the ability to select multiple options and activate them together (in version 4.0.0 it is not possible to multiple select to disable mods because it conflicts with the profiles functionality).`
- `Added the functionality to copy the name of each patch with Ctrl + C and Ctrl + Shift + C to copy the description.`
- `By right clicking on the title bar you will see two new options, one to restart Forger and another to reset it to default settings.`
- `The search bar inside the option group window can search for more than one word separated with * for example sleeves*01.`
- `The "rescan" and "install updates" buttons have become icons.`
- `The "reset all forges" button has been renamed to "RAF".`
- `Added a new button that takes you to the ForgerPatches folder.`
- `Added high resolution game banners.`
- `The way to select the .exe game has been changed. From now on, a bar with the path will not be displayed and it will be a simple banner that is in the same position as the game banners (if you want to change games, just click on the banner, regardless of whether a game is selected).`
- `The ability to edit .exe files was added, therefore editing .forge and .exe is now supported (exe editing does not support using DataOptionGroups, therefore, to change to another value it is possible to do so directly from the forger interface. .. just right click on the patch).`
- `A color picker window was added so that you can change the color of mods that modify an RGBA file... just right click on the patch and the color picker will open (if you are a modder and want to use the color picker, you must write 'RGBA' in the PatchID of the .forger2 file).`
- `Added functionality that works to install mods, from now on simply drag your files into the window and they will be unzipped or moved to the ForgerPatches folder.`
- `Added DPI/screen scaling support (not sure if it works, I'm assuming it does because I had to resize pretty much everything).`
- `The font has been changed and will now use the "Noto Sans Mono" font.`
- `Exe verification has been changed so if a mod is not set to Plus it will still show patches and you can apply them (for those using Ubi Plus).`
- `𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗳𝗶𝗹𝗲 𝗳𝘂𝗻𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗵𝗮𝘀 𝗯𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗮𝗱𝗱𝗲𝗱. Therefore, from now on, you will have a button to save the profile with the mods you have activated in an XML file. Then, when you drag the XML into the program, those mods will be applied https://youtu.be/X0cUG8BWgbo`
